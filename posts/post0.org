On [[http://orgmode.org/][orgmode.org]], the description of org-mode is:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning
  projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text
  system.

  Created by Carsten Dominik in 2003, maintained by Bastien Guerry and
  developed by many others.

To me, the most important aspects are:
  - The code evaluation, Babel or =ob.el=.
  - A nice syntax that's more powerful than Markdown, but easier than
    LaTeX.
  - the excellent export framework, =ox.el=.

It is distributed as part of [[https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
