Latest preview build for SailfishOS - Fiskarsinjoki(2.0.4.14) is
released and available for download. SailfishOS uses [[http://merproject.org/][Mer]] middleware,
has [[https://kernel.org][Linux kernel]] and developed by [[https://jolla.com/][jolla]]. The latest release is not yet
available on air but can be upgraded using developer mode.

*** Enable remote SSH

    With SailfishOS, debugging a phone is quite simple, one just needs
    to enable **Developer mode** & **Remote connection** from
    *Developer tools*. Provide the password for user *nemo*(Yes, the
    default user is =nemo=) or generate password if you choose not to
    enter password of your choice.(I never managed to ssh to
    IP-address 192.168.2.15 even by setting similar network space)

    Login as root using the command =devel-su=
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      [nemo@Sailfish ~]$ devel-su
      Password:
      [root@Sailfish nemo]#
    #+END_SRC

*** Update

    Verify the current release by using the command =version=. Check
    the latest release on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS][wiki]]. Say you want to update to latest
    release(2.0.4.14, at the time when this post was published), set
    the release version using command =ssu release VERSION=
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      ssu release 2.0.4.14
      version --dup
    #+END_SRC

    This should take a while.

*** Remove default package

    To remove preinstall package like *gaana*, search by name using
    the command =pkcon=(PackageKit Console client).
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      [root@Sailfish ~]# pkcon search name gaana

      Installed sailfish-content-partnerspaces-intex-gaana-0.1.5-10.8.1.jolla.armv7hl	Gaana partner space application for Intex
    #+END_SRC

    Once the exact name of the package is found, go ahead and remove
    the package using =pkcon remove PACKAGE_NAME=. Exclude version
    number. =pkcon= should behave like any other package manager found
    in various GNU/Linux distros.

*** Verify & install package

    Sometime you may want to check the integrity of an OS. In this
    case the command =version --verify= will come handy as
    demonstrated below.

*** Verify an update

    After an upgrade, login to the device and verify few parameter as show
    below.

    I found SailfishOS much more comfortable to use. The best part is
    it has very good user interface as compared to other mobile UI
    like Android. Once you have an Jolla account, the device has
    access to all package repositories. It has early access to latest
    version and upgrade is quite simple. The device comes pre-rooted
    with entire GNU/Linux OS and package-manager(=pkcon=). One can
    install all Android apps either from Jolla store or using Google
    Play store.
