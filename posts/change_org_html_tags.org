#+title: Change default org-mode HTML tags

This brief post is result of a [[https://plus.google.com/110929313922902668537/posts/8FLNDvKc3sp][question]] posted by Icaro Perseo. He
used org-mode for blogging using [[https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog][org2blog]], but was not satisfied with
default HTML tags used by org-mode.

He wanted to change the default emphasis on text when it is converted
to HTML in org-mode. By default during conversion from org to HTML,

=/text/= converts to =<i>text</i>=

and

=*text*= converts to =<b>text</b>=

Instead, he wanted to use =<em>= and =<strong>= instead of =<i>= and
=<b>=.

Well, everything can be customized from Emacs and Icaro's solution to
his problem lies in the customization of group `org-appearance`. To
customize this group, type
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  M-x customize-group org-appearance
#+END_SRC

and search for the variable =Org Emphasis Alist=

   #+CAPTION: Variable: Org Emphasis Alist
   #+ATTR_HTML: :alt Variable: Org Emphasis Alist :title Variable: Org Emphasis Alist :align center
   #+ATTR_HTML: :width :height

Now change the value of **HTML start tag** and **HTML end tag** to
whatever you want.
