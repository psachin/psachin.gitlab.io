  I try not to be biased with any programming language or technology.
  I work on GNU/Linux and Free & Open Source Software for living. If
  you are passionate about GNU and Free Software like me, I encourage
  you to watch this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er1pM9suxvE][YouTube video]] by Benjamin Mako Hill.

** @Home

   My current system is [[https://plus.google.com/photos/photo/113870692888444102463/6355020254313100738?icm=false&sqid=104043194426129544738&ssid=2c4bb3f4-0eed-4d83-9385-eb6e51a01dc9][Lenovo G505s]] with AMD A8 Quad-core processor
   and 8 Gigs of RAM running Slackware 14.1(I always prefer [[https://github.com/psachin/bash_scripts/blob/master/build_my_kernel.sh][latest
   kernel]]. I usually work on this system.

   My other system includes /Acer emachines eM350/ netbook running
   [[https://manjaro.org/][Manjaro Linux]] an independently developed [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]]. I've [[http://awesomewm.org][Awesome
   window manager]] on it. I use it as a hotspot using [[https://github.com/psachin/hotspotd][hotspotd]]. +I also
   have an old desktop with AMD Athlon with 2 Gigs of RAM running+
   +Slackware again!. The system's storage is shared via NFS across my
   home network, basically this is my NFS server.+

   Apart from this I had a very old Intel Pentium II Machine with
   350MHz processor and 64MB of RAM running Vector Linux. +I wonder
   how this machine [[https://plus.google.com/+Sachinp/posts/UMCp3L6NiAn?pid=5864821069617337218&oid=113870692888444102463][still runs?]]+

   Most of my home network and Internet connection is managed by
   D-LINK DIR-615E wireless router flashed with custom
   [[https://openwrt.org/][OpenWRT(barrier-breaker)]]. This is my backup(and tiny) Linux system
   with minimal shell and =opkg= package manager.

** @Work

   For work, I have Lenovo Thinkpad T440p running [[https://getfedora.org/][Fedora]].

** Tools I use

   #+ATTR_HTML: :class center no-border
   [[file:../../images/about/tools-server-small.png]]

   [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] and a terminal are the least I need.

   I prefer to use latest Emacs version. My Emacs is heavily
   [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/emacs.d][configured]] for all my needs from programming(Python, Django, C,
   elisp, Ruby, shell etc.), blogs & note taking[[https://orgmode.org/][(org-mode)]], eshell,
   tramp, magit etc. Recently I fell in love with =M-x
   emacs-timemachine=. Terminal is occasionally needed to keep some
   front-end jobs running.

   [[http://git-scm.com][Git]] is something I can't live without. I use Git to keep track of
   my personal notes, blogs, and all the projects. =magit= is a
   savior. It helps me a lot to learn insights of Git.

   I prefer [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusTutorial][Gnus]] over [[http://www.mutt.org/][mutt]] to manage mails.

** More..

   I find programming in =elisp= relaxing when I'm bored with Python
   and friends. Though not much but I do write helper functions and
   share it on [[http://sachin.pythonanywhere.com][sachin.pythonanywhere.com]].

** Blogs

   #+ATTR_HTML: :class center no-border
   [[file:../../images/about/Anonymous-pen-pencil-small.png]]

   For raw/old posts please visit [[https://github.com/psachin/blog-posts][blog-posts]]. Most of them are written
   in [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]. I now use [[https://jekyllrb.com/][jekyll]] to publish my blogs(Source [[https://github.com/psachin/psachin.github.io][here]]).
   Jekyll uses markdown which I don't like much. +I miss org-mode to
   post blogs.+ This website is [[https://gitlab.com/psachin/psachin.gitlab.io][entirely published]] using org-mode.
